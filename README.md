# Pomodoro App

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. 
It breaks work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro.

### How it works

1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Start the Pomodoro timer
3. Work on the task
4. End work when the timer rings and take a break (5 â€“ 10 minutes)
5. Go back to Step 1 and repeat until you complete four Pomodoros
6. Take a long break (20 to 30 minutes) after four Pomodoros
7. Return to step 1
